  <p>Boids is a flocking simulation program, first designed by Craig Reynolds in 1986 and published in 1987. The name comes from "bird-oid objects", or "bird-like objects."</p>
  <p>The world that they fly in is a torus, meaning that it wraps top to bottom and left to right. In addition, each boid is colored based on its heading.</p>
  <p>There are three main rules that the individual boids follow:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Separation: </b>Steers to avoid nearby boids</li>
    <li><b>Alignment: </b>Steers to move in the same direction as nearby boids</li>
    <li><b>Cohesion: </b>Steers toward the center of mass of nearby boids</li>
  </ul>
