    \
    ROBOT height, as measured when it's resting normally on a \
flat floor, may not exceed the maximum STARTING CONFIGURATION height (4 ft. 4 in. (~132 \
cm)) unless any part of the ROBOT'S BUMPERS is in its HANGAR ZONE, in which case its height \
may not exceed 5 ft. 6 in. (~167 cm). ROBOTS may not extend more than 16 in. (~40 cm) beyond their \
FRAME PERIMETER. A ROBOT may not position itself such that any part of its BUMPERS is higher than \
the HIGH RUNG. ROBOTS may never extend beyond the PURPLE PLANE. ROBOTS may not PIN an opponent's ROBOT for more than 5 \
seconds. \
<br>\
A ROBOT may not contact (either directly or transitively through CARGO and \
regardless of who initiates contact) an opponent ROBOT whose BUMPERS are contacting their \
LAUNCH PAD. A ROBOT may not contact (either directly or transitively through CARGO and \
regardless of who initiates contact). A ROBOT may not be fully supported by a partner ROBOT. \
<br>\
During AUTO, a ROBOT with any part of its BUMPERS on the opposite \
side of the FIELD (i.e. on the other side of the CENTER LINE from its ALLIANCE'S TARMACS) may \
contact neither an opponent ROBOT nor CARGO still in its staged location on the opposite side of \
the FIELD.\
<br>\
ROBOTS may not have greater-than-MOMENTARY CONTROL of more than 2 \
CARGO at a time, either directly or transitively through other objects. A ROBOT may not REPEATEDLY gain greater-than-MOMENTARY CONTROL \
of CARGO released by an UPPER EXIT until and unless that CARGO contacts anything else \
besides that ROBOT or CARGO controlled by that ROBOT.";

ZONE includes the tape. Also includes SHADOW LINE: a black line that lies directly below the MID RUNG. A team will earn 4 points for hanging on the LOW RUNG, 6 points on the MID RUNG, 10 points on the HIGH RUNG, and 15 points on the TRAVERSAL RUNG. If an ALLIANCE earns 16 HANGAR points, it earns (1) additional RANKING POINT.\
\
A HANGAR is located in front of each HANGAR WALL and DRIVER STATION 1. A HANGAR assembly \
consists of truss structure, bases, 4 RUNGS, RUNG mounting brackets, floor protection, and 2 LAUNCH \
PADS. The maximum ROBOT height limit described in G106 is marked on the center of each horizontal \
truss assembly in black tape (i.e. the bottom edge of the tape is 5 ft. 6 in. (~168 cm) above FIELD carpet). \
<br>\
Each HANGAR has 4 RUNGS highlighted in Figure 5-16: LOW, MID, HIGH, and TRAVERSAL. RUNGS are 1¼ \
in. Schedule 40 steel pipes, with a 1.66 in. (~4 cm) outer diameter, and are powder coated to reflect the \
ALLIANCE color. RUNGS are 7 ft. (~213 cm) wide and bound by the truss and brackets (note that pipe\
that overlaps the truss structure and brackets is not considered part of the RUNG).\
\
The top of the LOW RUNG is 4 ft. ¾ in. (~124 cm) above \
FIELD carpet. The top of the MID RUNG is 5 ft. ¼ in. (~153 cm) above floor protection carpet, and its \
center is 3 ft. 6 in. (~107 cm) from the center of the LOW RUNG. The top of the HIGH RUNG is 6 ft. 3⅝ in. \
(~192 cm) above floor protection carpet, and the top of the TRAVERSAL RUNG is 7 ft. 7 in. (~231 cm) \
above floor protection carpet. MID, HIGH, and TRAVERSAL RUNGS are spaced such that their centers are \
2 ft. (~61 cm) apart. The horizontal distance between the center of the TRAVERSAL RUNG and the \
ALLIANCE WALL is 3 ft. 3 in. (~99 cm).");

located 2 ft. (~61 cm) from the back of the TERMINAL AREA. \
<br>\
One TERMINAL is in each of the 2 FIELD corners opposite the HANGARS. Each TERMINAL is shared \
between ALLIANCES. A TERMINAL consists of 1 ramp, 1 GUARD, 1 PURPLE PLANE, 1 CHUTE, and other \
structure elements shown in Figure 5-20. Each TERMINAL has 5 CARGO delivery openings through which \
ROBOTS may transfer CARGO to HUMAN PLAYERS. The space between the PURPLE PLANE and the \
retention chain can hold approximately 10 CARGO. \
\
Each TERMINAL is 4 ft. (~122 cm) deep, 8 ft. 1⅛ in. (~247 cm) wide (excluding the ends of the ramp) and \
is a maximum of 5 ft. 1¾ in. (~157 cm) tall. A 2¾ in. (~7 cm) tall ramp leads to the 1 ft. 5¼ in. (~44 cm) wide, 1 ft. (~30 cm) tall openings.")

(an UPPER HUB and a LOWER HUB), UPPER and LOWER EXITS, and 4 fenders. The HUB is 8 ft. 11 in. \
(~272 cm) wide by 8 ft. 11 in. (~272 cm) deep by 8 ft. 8 in. (~264 cm) tall. CARGO in the LOWER HUB during AUTONOMOUS is worth 2 points, and CARGO in the UPPER HUB during AUTONOMOUS is worth 4 points. Point values are halved during the TELEOPERATED period of the match.\
If 20 or more ALLIANCE colored CARGO is scored in the HUB, an ALLIANCE earns (1) additional RANKING POINT. If at least 5 ALLIANCE colored CARGO are scored in AUTO, called a QUIINTET, this threshold drops to 18. \
<br>\
An agitator extends up the center of each HUB and rotates throughout the MATCH. Generally, the agitator \
causes a single CARGO dropped into the UPPER HUB to reenter play in approximately 7 seconds and a \
CARGO dropped in the LOWER HUB to reenter play in approximately 5 seconds. An UPPER EXIT is 1 of the 4 extensions on which CARGO leaves the UPPER HUB, and a LOWER EXIT is \
one of the 4 tunnels from which CARGO leaves the LOWER HUB. \
<br>\
4 legs, each centered under an UPPER EXIT, support the UPPER HUB. The maximum ROBOT height \
defined in G106 is marked with black tape on each leg (i.e. the bottom edge of the tape is 4 ft. 4 in. (~132 \
cm) above FIELD carpet). A fender is located in between each of the LOWER EXITS. \
<br>\
The opening of the LOWER HUB is 3 ft. 5 in. (~104 cm) above FIELD carpet, and the opening of the UPPER \
HUB is 8 ft. 8 in. (~264 cm) above the FIELD carpet. A web of #2 black plastic chain is hung 7½ in. (~19 \
cm) below the rim of the LOWER HUB opening. \
\
The UPPER HUB opening has a 4-ft. (~122-cm) diameter, and the LOWER HUB opening has a 5-ft. ⅛ in. \
(~153 cm) diameter. he UPPER HUB is marked with a single 360° vision target consisting of 5 in. (~13 cm) long strips of 2 in. \
(~5 cm) wide 3M 8830 Scotchlite™ Reflective Material. A sample of the material is included in each \
Rookie Kickoff Kit and FIRST Choice. The target is a 4 ft. 5⅜ in. (~136 cm) diameter ring of plastic with 16 \
strips adhered to it with 5½ in. (~14 cm) gaps between them. The ring is aligned such that 1 of the gaps is \
centered over each UPPER EXIT. The distance from FIELD carpet to the top of the target is 8 ft. 8 in. \
(~264 cm). \
\
The HUB is surrouned by CARGO RING: 1 of 14 small rings used to keep the CARGO in place prior to the start of the \
MATCH. Rings are ⅛ in. (~3mm) thick, 1¾ in. (~4 cm) diameter O-rings (McMaster Item#: \
9452K63). 12 rings are placed around the HUB, and 1 ring is in front of each TERMINAL. They \
are secured to FIELD carpet with red or blue tape to indicate the color CARGO to be placed on \
it.");
