    assembly that swings from the top of the SHIELD GENERATOR. Each GENERATOR SWITCH has a \
    HANDLE. The HANDLE is a structure that consists of a RUNG and the supporting structure below the \
    horizontal beam of the GENERATOR SWITCH. A RUNG is a 1¼ in. schedule 40 aluminum pipe (1.66 in. \
    (~4 cm) outer diameter) with two (2) exposed 4 ft. 7⅝ in. (~141 cm) long sections. The amount of \
    clearance above the RUNG varies from a minimum of 3½ in (~9 cm) to a maximum of 12 in (~30 cm). For \
    safety, foam corner cushions line the lowest edges of the HANDLE. The SHIELD GENERATOR has a set of stack lights for each ALLIANCE which are enabled from the start \
    of the END GAME until five (5) seconds after the MATCH. These lights illuminate when the corresponding \
    GENERATOR SWITCH is LEVEL. \
    Each half of the SHIELD GENERATOR features three (3) ALLIANCE colored light bars inside of the truss \
    structure. \
    The first light bar, inside the vertical truss section adjacent to the ALLIANCE’S TRENCH, \
    turns on once Stage 1 is ACTIVATED. \

    PORT, turns on once Stage 2 is ACTIVATED. \
    The third light bar, inside the horizontal truss connecting the two (2) previous truss sections, \
